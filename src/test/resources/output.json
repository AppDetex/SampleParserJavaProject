  "description": "\"Catan\", the legendary strategy game provides gaming fun anytime, anywhere. True to the original game, you can compete with up to four players for the most settlements, the longest roads and the largest army. You can trade with each other and claim the precious land with all its resources. Challenge other Catan fans online via cross-platform multiplayer to prove your strategy skill or play against the AI: Various computer opponents, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his... The popular Catan expansions \"Seafarers\" and \"Cities and Knights\" are available as In-App purchases. The complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy! The Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan – but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan’s new wealth! You’ll need your best knights to fend them off! C\u0026K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.

Answer: The download from Google play includes the basic game data and a tool that will determine your device’s display resolution and then download the optimal graphics data for your device. Question: Which Android security permissions does Catan need and why? Answer: “Storage” to write data to the SD or move the game data, “Network communication” to download game data and access the In App Store and “system tools” to check if Catan is already running to resume a game. Question: I bought one of the expansions but after an update, reinstallation of Catan or after restoring my phone the expansion seems gone? Answer: Don’t worry; your initial purchase is already saved in your Google account. However for technical reasons you might have to select “Buy” again. Confirm and a message will tell you that you’ve already purchased it. You will NOT be billed twice! Question: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating from or when restoring my phone. Is there any way to restore it? Answer: Savegames from old versions can usually be restored automatically. For all other cases we’ve integrated a cheat code: Enter campaign mode and go to select player. Enter „CatanWarp*“ (* \u003d 1–15, e.g \"CatanWarp5\") as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button. Enter your phone’s settings menu. Select applications/manage applications/Catan/ and then “Force Stop”. Restart Catan. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number by selecting “New scenario *”. ***** ***** Suggestions for improvements and feature requests?
