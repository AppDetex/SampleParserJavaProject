PROJECT DESCRIPTION
===================

    This project is a web scraper utility for the Google Play App store. It takes a URL as input and uses Jsoup to parse necessary application information including title, description, publisher, price, and rating from the store's page. This information is then converted to a JSON formatted string, UTF-8 encoded.

    I chose to encode the strings in UTF-8 because it is the dominant character encoding for the WWWW.
