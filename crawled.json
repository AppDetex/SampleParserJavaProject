WhatsApp uses your phone\u0027s Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family. Switch from SMS to WhatsApp to send and receive messages, calls, photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages. WHY USE WHATSAPP: • NO FEES: WhatsApp uses your phone\u0027s Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family, so you don\u0027t have to pay for every message or call.* There are no subscription fees to use WhatsApp. • MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages. • FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if they\u0027re in another country.* WhatsApp calls use your phone\u0027s Internet connection rather than your cellular plan\u0027s voice minutes. (Note: Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details. Also, you can\u0027t access 911 and other emergency service numbers through WhatsApp). • GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group chats with your contacts so you can easily stay in touch with your friends or family. • WHATSAPP WEB: You can also send and receive WhatsApp messages right from your computer\u0027s browser. • NO INTERNATIONAL CHARGES: There\u0027s no extra charge to send WhatsApp messages internationally. Chat with your friends around the world and avoid international SMS charges.* • SAY NO TO USERNAMES AND PINS: Why bother having to remember yet another username or PIN? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS, and integrates seamlessly with your phone\u0027s existing address book. • ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you\u0027re always logged in so you don\u0027t miss messages. No more confusion about whether you\u0027re logged in or logged out. • QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there\u0027s no need to add hard-to-remember usernames. • OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your recent messages until the next time you use the app. • AND MUCH MORE: Share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers and notification sounds, email chat history, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and more! *Data charges may apply.
