# TODO
Make this a real readme

# Kotlin
- Get Maven to build with default
- Change Main to kt
- Implement basic hello world
- implement scrape of url provided
- html to json
- json to string fomat
- print string


# Really Should do
- Figure out spock testing
- Test parser
- Testing curl isn't necessary due to base functionality
- Testing to string shouldn't be required either
- Use VCR if we decide to get fancy
